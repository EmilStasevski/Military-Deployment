# Military-Deployment

The current repository encompasses the International Military Deployments Dataset (IMDT) and is dedicated to the development of an academic paper revolving around its analysis. This dataset provides comprehensive coverage of military deployments conducted by 162 countries worldwide within the period spanning from 1985 to 2022. Structured in a dyad format, the data elucidates instances where a particular country deploys its military personnel in a given year, encompassing a range of pertinent features such as military mission typologies, military assets, international mandates, and more. In its entirety, the dataset comprises 19,671 unique dyads, each representing a distinct military deployment event.
