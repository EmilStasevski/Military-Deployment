# Parsing Military Balances IISS
This repository presents strategies for **automating the data collection** process of the annual reports 
published by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) on the [Military
Balance](https://www.iiss.org/en/publications/the-military-balance/).

The parsing is divided in following sections:
 - [Splitting annual Military Balance IISS reports into countries' paragraphs](https://github.com/EmilStasevski/Military-Deployment/tree/main/Data%20collection/Parsing%20Military%20Balances%20IISS/Parsing%20paragraphs)
 - [Parsing countries' international military deployments](https://github.com/EmilStasevski/Military-Deployment/tree/main/Data%20collection/Parsing%20Military%20Balances%20IISS/Military%20deployment)
 - [Parsing countries military capabilities (Army, Navy, Air Force) - in process]()
